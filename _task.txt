2. FizzBuzz++ (Node/JS)

Testing: general programming, succinctness, readability

---

Write a script that will be executed from the command line.

The script should echo the numbers 1 to 500, each number being on a new line.

Output required in addition to the number:

If the number is divisible by 3 the script should echo 'FIZZ', if the
number is divisible by 5 the script should echo 'BUZZ'.

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 the script should echo 'FIZZBUZZ'.

If the number is a prime, echo 'FiZZBUZZ++'

The same script should also log the above output to a file called
fizzbuzz.log. Data that may already be in the fizzbuzz.log file should
not be overwritten.
